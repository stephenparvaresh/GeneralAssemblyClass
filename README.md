# GeneralAssemblyClass
Projects from the Part Time General Assembly Data Science Course

# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
I took this class to improve my data science skills. The projects included here are:

* Python coding exercises
* Analyzing IMDb Data
* Linear Regression and KNN - Train/Test Split
* A capstone project in which I analyzed Instacart Market Basket data and created a model to predict what an individual would buy next based on their cart. 

# File Descriptions
There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks are exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
